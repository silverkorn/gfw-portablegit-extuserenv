# Git For Windows - PortableGit Extended User Environment
These simple scripts were created if you wish to add some extended options when using PortableGit instead of the installed version due to administration restrictions or so.

## Features
- Add Right-click context menus "Git-Bash" & "Git Gui" for the current user
- Add the "cmd" directory of your PortableGit in the user's PATH environment variable
- Can be reused whenever you need to change your PortableGit destination
- Contain an uninstaller

## Setup
1. Simply copy the `tools` directory in the root of your PortableGit directory
2. Launch `tools\portablegit-install.cmd` and you're done
* If you wish to remove those options, simply launch `tools\portablegit-uninstall.cmd`
